### Introduction:

    Well, Actually I don't know is it need an introduction. Because I just like to write software, That's Enough! But, a good introduction is a part of good software. So There's it. Here we go.

    This package include a basic game engine logiction. Such as render, game object, world editor. All of them is opened to you in a simple way. I try to make the code as easy as I can. So let's see what will happen next.

##### Version 1.X

    This is the first version of this engine. Actually it can't be called as a game engine. In the early version it's more like a GUI model. This version I make some function to easy make the pygame windows create easy and how to due with event.

    This version only have a work -- The competition work.

##### Version 2.x

    This Version compare to the first version had a great improvment. That's Tree Struct. After learning algorithms my code had a unbelivable improvment. That I can use a lot of different struct to due with different problem.

    This version didn't have any new work now. But it will coming soon.

    And, This version is still developing.
